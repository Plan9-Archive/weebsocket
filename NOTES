Don't trust size field sent from client!  Limit to read()'s return
value or we could overflow.

Currently we're allocating a 16kb buffer for each packet received.
This is likely suboptimal.

The Bio buffer size for outgoing packets should perhaps be tuned to
(max input pkt + max header size) so that write(2) will only be called
on Bflush(2),
