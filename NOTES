Best strategy: modify libhttpd to list all headers.
/sys/src/libhttpd/parse.c:mimeconnection
is the relevant function.

/sys/include/httpd.h:HttpHead
struct meant to store all parsed headers.
Currently it only stores headers recognised specially by libhttpd.
Add a field
	HSPairs *all; /* all headers */
to store every header (or just unrecognised?)

Currently we can get the raw headers from HConnect.header,
but we have to parse them ourselves.

With the change, HConnect.head.all would be a list of key-value pairs.
